Screenevents app
====================

One of the examples we provide with the toolkit that demonstrates how you attach events and read inputs from the screens

1) Check out smt_screeneventsapp in Eclipse
2) Build a war using the 'deploy-war' task with the provided build.xml
3) Do not deploy it in tomcat!, we use the war format but it should be loaded in Lou so use the application manager
